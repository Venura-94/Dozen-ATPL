The trouble was, and still is, that balloons are non-steerable and are dependent on the  wind to provide their horizontal motive power.",

During the overshoot the engineer reported that he had seen the runway lights as they passed over the threshold. In the following discussion the captain briefed for a split approach, in which the co-pilot would fly on instruments whilst the captain would take over for the landing. As part of the briefing the captain told the other pilot not to start the missed approach at decision height but to level out until told to climb. This decision whilst strictly illegal was supported by the navigator who told the rest of the crew that the ground was level at this stage with no obstructions. With the captain, engineer and navigator looking out the co-pilot flew to decision height. At this stage one crew member called \u2018lights\u2019 and a few seconds later the captain saw the runway lights below. He took control and executed a rapid descent and a firm landing.",

This would have automatically disconnected the autopilot and triggered a whole series of warnings in the cockpit (stall warning; autopilot disconnect; master warning; and the stick push operating). Sometime around this point Key had another, larger, heart attack where his heart muscle actually separated due to the blood pressure in a ruptured arteriole. He may not have been incapacitated but he would certainly have been in great pain. As the nose dropped, one of the pilots pulled back on the column in an attempt to hold the aircraft level. It stabilized at around 177 kt in a slight descent. No attempt was made to redeploy either the flaps or the droops. The climb was then reinitiated by pulling back on the column. The stall warning and stick push operated for a second time. Again the crew attempted to hold the aircraft level instead of diving the aircraft, applying power and deploying the high lift devices. The third time the stick push system operated it was overridden by dumping the pressure in the system (remember that the crew may have thought that it was faulty as a result of the previous warnings). It is likely that Key did this as the override was on his side of the centre pedestal. By now airspeed had increased to around 193 kt as a result of being in a shallow dive but for some reason the aircraft was reestablished back into the climb once again. Airspeed decayed to about 175 kt and it entered the stall, followed shortly after by adopting a 60\u00b0 nose-up attitude (as the Trident was prone to do in these circumstances). This led to the aircraft entering a deep stall from which there was no recovery. The aircraft\u2019s altitude at this point was 1275 feet (AGL) and it was travelling at no more than 54 kt. The Trident fell out of the sky in a flat spin, crashing next to the A30 near Staines Reservoir. All 118 passengers and crew on board were killed in the impact.",
